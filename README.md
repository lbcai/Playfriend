# Playfriend
Playfriend is a Discord bot coded in Python 3.9.0 with Discord.py and hosted on Heroku. The app site is handled using Flask and redirects to the bot invite link for convenience.

## Current Features
*   Hangman: play a hangman game hosted by the bot with a word from 728 possible GRE vocabulary words. Users can also submit their own custom word for other players to guess.
*   Tic tac toe: play a tic tac toe game in 1 or 2-player variations. 1-player games are played against the bot AI while 2-player games can be played with other chat members. Users can pick any default emoji as their marker on the board.

## Planned Features
*   Dungeon Crawler: play alone or with a party and travel through a randomly-generated dungeon! Collect loot, upgrade your character, fight boss battles, and deal with a huge variety of random encounters. Sprites for maps, monsters, and items in the form of custom emojis make the game visually interesting.
