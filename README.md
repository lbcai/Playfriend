Playfriend is a Discord bot coded in Python 3.9.0 with Discord.py and hosted on Render (formerly hosted on Heroku). The site is currently in progress and uses Flask, React, and MongoDB.

This bot was written by [lbcai](https://github.com/lbcai) as a Python & web hosting learning exercise. More features are planned.

Sprites for maps, monsters, and items in the form of custom emojis make the game visually interesting.
